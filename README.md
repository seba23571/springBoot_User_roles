# springBoot_User_roles
this project was inspired by this source https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-boot-jwt-authentication/#Source_Code
including some personal updates for my current jobs. it was later dockerized
spring boot backend with postgres using user roles for different privileges. 
Currently this application is in use with android mobile device in frond end as well as desktop application in java.
It would be interesting feedback for improvements and suggestions.
for users who also want to do the same as me or something similar.

notes after running for the first time it is important to run the sql script data.sql and data2.sql.

since postgres database uses triggers and functions for the correct operation.
